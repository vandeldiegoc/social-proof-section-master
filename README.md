## About

A frontend code challenge by [frontendmentor.io](https://frontendmentor.io). The goal of the challenge is to build a social proof section that is responsive on both mobile and desktop.

This is a version 2 which is an improvement of the previous solution. This solution incorporates **css-grids**, **flex-box**, and **relative values** to make the web interface truely responsive.
